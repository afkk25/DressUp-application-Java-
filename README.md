# Project Description
The DressUp Application is a Java-based project that simulates a clothing management system where users can manage their clothing collections. It allows users to add, remove, modify, sort, and search through a list of clothing items such as sweaters, suits, and work uniforms. The application also supports loading and saving the collection to a file.

The primary goal of this project is to provide users with a simple interface to manage a collection of clothing items, incorporating features such as persistence (saving data), sorting, and searching.

This project includes two main classes in the **aui/project** for interacting with a clothing management system:

## 1. DressUp.java
Purpose: Manages user accounts, profiles, shipping, and payments.

Key Features:
  - Create and manage accounts and profiles.
  - Add shipping and payment information.
  - Process a predefined list of 4 clothing items.

Usage: Run this class to handle user registration and payment processes.
## 2. Deliverable4.java
Purpose: Provides advanced clothing collection management (CRUD operations).

Key Features:
  - Add, remove, modify, and sort clothing items.
  - Search items by price and category.
  - Load and save collections to a file.

Usage: Run this class to manage a dynamic clothing collection with persistent data storage.
